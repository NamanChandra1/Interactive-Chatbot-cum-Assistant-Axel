Generally, it takes about three months after the issuance of the Interim Judgment for the Certificate of Making Interim Judgment Final will be issued.

   "response": "If you are sued for divorce, you will be served with the Writ of Divorce with other court documents. It is important that you read all documents carefully. If you do not understand anything, it is recommended that you consult with a lawyer. It is important that you do not sign anything without understanding the consequences, for it could result in unintended outcomes. The first major decision you need to make is whether you wish to contest the divorce. Contesting the divorce simply means that you object to the divorce. If you wish to contest this, you will need to state so in the Memorandum of Appearance and then file a Defence and perhaps a counterclaim. Even if you decide not to contest, you can still challenge your spouse's proposals for custody, care and control, assess, maintenance, division of matrimonial assets, and costs. It is important for you to abide by the timelines stipulated in all these documents."

Then, if the court finds that the marriage has irretrievably broken down, the court may grant an Interim Judgment. Final Judgment can only be granted three months thereafter. If the divorce is contested, then the outstanding issues will need to be resolved, which will lengthen the process."

In deciding the type of custody order, the Court will look at the best interests of the child by considering money or physical comfort, the child? s moral, religious and physical well-being, ties of affection to the parent, etc. Where necessary, the Judge may ask for social service reports or counselling sessions to assess the child? s and parents? state and the type of custody order suited for them.In general, care and control is awarded to mothers, unless the mother agrees to the father? s request, or the child is at an age where he/she is able to express clearly to the Court his/her desire to stay with the father. If the mother is found to be abusive or neglectful of her child, the Court may order an evaluation report by the Family Court counsellor before coming to a decision."

For example, assets purchased or improved during the marriage or the matrimonial home would constitute matrimonial assets.Second, the Court will take into account many factors in deciding the division of the matrimonial assets. These factors include the direct and indirect contributions by each party towards the matrimonial assets, the child? s or children? s needs and any agreement between the parties on the division of the matrimonial assets. Direct contributions are financial contributions, whereas indirect contributions are non-financial contributions such as looking after the children or the home."

   "message": "I would like to know what is sole custody and joint custody ? Currently I am in a process of divorce and wants to have a clearer picture of sole and joint custody.",
   "response": "The Singapore Courts generally grant 4 types of custody: sole custody order, joint custody order, hybrid order and split custody order. Under a sole custody order, the parent granted sole custody of the child will be the sole decision maker for major decisions concerning the child. Under a joint custody order, both parents will be decision makers for major decisions concerning the child. Both parents will therefore need to communicate with one another and reach a consensus where key decisions are concerned. In other words, both parents have an equal say in the upbringing of the child. For hybrid orders, although one parent will be granted custody over the child, the custodial parent must consult the non-custodial parent on matters pertaining to the welfare of the child. Under a split custody order, custody of different siblings may be split between the parents. This, however, is not a common order by the Court."

   "message": "Can I bring the courts order showing I have joint custody to the police station to request them to assist me to follow me to my ex wife house and help me to see my children .",
   "response": "There is a distinction between custody and access. Joint custody allows you to make major decisions in your child's life, for eg, in his or her choice of school, religion, etc. However, by itself, joint custody does not assure you the right to visit your children on a regular basis. For that, you will need to have access rights granted by the court. As you have joint custody, it is likely that the court would also have made a decision on your access rights. Your right to visit your children will depend on the access rights granted by the court to you. As you have provided no details of such access rights, it is not possible for us to advise you on whether you can do what you have suggested."

If not, the Court may set a timetable for access or impose specific conditions to be complied with."

   "message": "How does the court decide on custody of a child in a divorce?",
   "response": "The Court decides two things: (a) custody, which is the right to make major decisions on the welfare and upbringing of the child; and (b) care and control, which is the right to have the child live with you and to make every day decisions regarding them. Custody can be shared but care and control normally lies with one parent.The Court considers the welfare of the child (such as the child? s emotional and physical well-being) to be the most important factor when deciding custody, and care and control. Relevant factors include:-the role that each parent has played in the child? s life-the stability that each parent can offer the child-whether the child? s existing care arrangements can be left as they are-the child? s age: care and control of a very young child will normally lie with the mother-whether there are siblings: the Court tries if possible not to separate siblings-the child? s wishes, if he or she is old enough to express an independent opinion-the parent? s wishes, which comes second to the welfare of the child"

They will investigate the matter and forward the results of their investigations to the AGC, who will decide whether a charge should be made. If either the Police or the AGC is of the view that no charges should be made but you remain of the view that a crime has been committed, you can file a Magistrate's Complaint. Information on how that is done can be found at this page: http://app.subcourts.gov.sg/criminal/page.aspx?pageid=10028"

This is provided that you did not commit murder or offences against the State punishable with death, and that you did not place yourself in such a situation of your own accord or based on threats short of instant death. Even if you fall short of this defence, the fact that you were tricked and forced may be regarded by the court as a mitigating factor and hence you may receive a lesser sentence.

   "response": "The first thing you should do is to inform ACRA of the invalid address. After informing ACRA, you could either wait or proceed according to the SCT? s instructions on service of the Notice of Consultation and a copy of the claim. The SCT advises that the Notice of Consultation and a copy of the claim should be sent to the registered address as stated in the latest ACRA business search. Since the Respondent? s registered business address is invalid, it is likely that the Registrar, Assistant Registrar or Referee who is hearing the matter will find that the documents have not been properly served on the Respondent. This is because you would not be able to submit a  ?delivered? status from Singpost. As such, you should try to serve the documents on a director of the Respondent company by way of personal service, registered or ordinary post, or any other mode of service as decided by the Registrar, Assistant Registrar or Referee hearing the matter."

In that case, it was held where a company sues its directors who have disposed of the company? s assets unlawfully or fraudulently in breach of their fiduciary duties, no limitation period prescribed by the Limitation Act applies. This is because section 22(1)(a) of the Limitation Act provides an exception for actions or lawsuits by a beneficiary under a trust, being an action in respect of any fraud or fraudulent breach of trust to which the trustee was a party or privy. A director who disposes of company property in breach of his fiduciary duties is treated as having acted in breach of trust, and therefore the exception would apply."

   "response": "It depends on the agreement. Was the agreement for you to help him to pay first, with him paying you back later? If so, then there is likely a valid contract. On the other hand, if the payment was a gift from him to you, then it would likely be unenforceable. Without a contract, it will be extremely difficult to successfully sue as there is no breach of contract. Before deciding to sue anyone, it is recommended you carefully consider the merits and strength of your case as litigation is an expensive process. The legal fees may amount to a sum larger than the size of your claim. Consider other alternative means of enforcing your agreement such as mediation.

   "response": "If you signed the loan document, then you cannot escape from your contractual obligation even in cases of fraud or misrepresentation. It may be possible to plead the defence of non est factum, that the written agreement was radically different from what you believed you were signing and that you had taken care in signing the document, if you are illiterate, for example. Otherwise, you may be able to sue the representative that dealt with you for fraud or misrepresentation, for inducing you into entering the loan agreement. The success of your action will depend on the circumstances."

However, the misrepresentation must be differentiated from the nature of a 'puff'. Also, a statement of the party's intention or opinion is also not a sufficient ground for relief. In this sense, the misrepresentation must be material, relating to a matter which would influence a reasonable person's decision whether to enter into the contract. The falsehood must have also inducted the contract."

   "message": "Can hotels refuse customers even if there is room available?",
   "response": "Yes certainly. Although the general principle is that hotels are bound to provide accommodation for fee-paying customers, but they are not bound to do so at all risks and all costs. For a start, hotels are mandated by regulations to refuse rooms to persons of bad character. Further, hotels also cannot permit any gaming, drunkenness, drug abuse or disorderly conduct to take place on its premises. This probably means that the hotel can refuse customers who reasonably seem prone to exhibit such tendencies. Quite apart from those regulations, hotels can also refuse guests who are unwilling or unable to pay for a room or if the occupancy of the guests would exceed the hotel? s maximum capacity."
 },
 {
   "message": "For petty crimes like stealing a lighting fixture, can hotels sue the guests?",
   "response": "Yes, hotels can sue guests for stealing items that belong to the hotel. The civil action is known as the tort of conversion. The hotel can claim damages resulting from the unlawful possession of its property. The hotel can of course also lodge a police report. If the guest is successfully prosecuted, then he may be liable to a fine or imprisonment for up to three years under the terms of the Penal Code."
 },
 {
   "message": "How hard is it to prove or disprove that something is stolen from a hotel room?",
   "response": "It really depends on the facts. Where there is clear evidence of forced entry, then that is clear proof of theft. In one Singaporean case, the guests? jewellery box was found to have been smashed. In another case, the guests? suitcases were ransacked. These constitute clear proof of theft. On the other hand, where there is no sign of forced entry, theft will be harder to proof. Indeed, in such cases, the guest may himself have been careless so as to afford the thief the easy opportunity to steal without much force or effort."
 },
 {
   "message": "What if you signed an agreement that hotel is not accountable for any loss of belongings? Are hotels allowed to do that?",
   "response": "Singapore cases have held that such clauses are ineffective. This is because the basis of the hotel? s responsibility does not lie in a private contract between it and the guest. Rather, it is imposed upon the hotel as a matter of law and as such, the hotel cannot contract out of this requirement by way of a clause in a private agreement. At best, such notices is no more than a warning to the guest that they must do their part to take care of their things themselves."
 },
 {
   "message": "Are hotels liable to the belongings of their guests? Up to what extend?",
   "response": "Yes, they are, but the extent of their liability depends on the circumstances. In law, the hotel is regarded as insurer of the belongings of his guests. Therefore, if such belongings are lost or stolen within the confines of the hotel, the hotel must make good to its guests any damage or loss to the belongings. However, the hotel may not be liable for the full extent of the guests? loss. The hotel can escape liability if it can show that the guest himself was careless and that the carelessness led to the loss of the belongings. Another way in which the hotel can escape liability is if it has put up a display limiting its liability. This display must follow the terms of section 3(1) of Innkeepers? Act. Where the display is properly exhibited in a conspicuous part of the hotel, then, subject to very few exceptions, the hotel? s liability to its guests will be limited to $500 only. However, this display will not be effective in restricting the hotel? s liability when the theft occurred through its negligence or fault."

   "response": "This depends on whether 'expenses incurred' induced the conclusion of the contract. The contract may be set aside for misrepresentation of the 'expenses incurred', but the party now seeking to set aside the contract must show that the misrepresentation had caused him or her to enter into the contract. It is also important to note that misrepresentation is difficult to prove in practice, and may involve other more difficult issues."

There may be other legal requirements that apply, but the most relevant document is usually the contract, which governs the legal obligations and liabilities of both parties."

   "message": "Is it legal to take over the monthly instalments of someone else's car?",
   "response": "A car loan is governed by an agreement between the lender and the borrower. The borrower is usually the owner of the car. As with any agreement, the car loan agreement can be varied so that a third party \"takes over\" the obligation of paying the instalments for the car loan. However, this must be agreed to by the lender, the borrower and the third party. Alternatively, the borrower / owner of the car can enter into a private agreement with the third party under which the third party agrees with the borrower / owner of the car to pay the instalments for the car loan. In such a case, the lender is not involved and the private agreement is strictly a relationship between the borrower / owner of the car and the third party only. The borrower / owner of the car remains liable to repay the car loan to the lender under the original car loan agreement. Therefore, if the third party fails to pay the instalments, the lender can have recourse to the borrower / owner of the car and may exercise the rights (if any) under the car loan agreement to take possession of the car. The borrower / owner of the car will have to enforce the private agreement against the third party separately."

   "message": "What if there is no written contract?",
   "response": "It does not matter that the contract is not written. Contracts may be made orally or in writing. In addition, there need not be a formal contract as such; the agreement between the parties may be contained in a series of correspondence, such as emails or letters. Once there is an agreement between the parties, the ambit of the agreement must be determined. If the ambit is found to cover the issue in question, then there would be a breach if the supplier fails to provide goods or services provided for under the agreement. Even if the contract is silent on the quality of goods, various statutes imply the condition that the goods must be in sufficiently good condition or match their description. Hence, the lack of a written contract, or even the absence of specific terms as to the fitness of goods, is not necessarily fatal to a claim against a supplier for breach of contract."
 },
 {
   "message": "If the supplier supplies goods or services which do not match their description, can the consumer sue?",
   "response": "Yes, the consumer will be able to sue for breach of contract. If the contract provides a description of the goods or services to be provided, that is a term of the contract that has to be satisfied by the supplier. If the supplier does not satisfy those terms, he would have breached the contract. Such breach of contract enables the consumer to sue either int the Small Claims Tribunal or a higher level court if the claim amount is sufficiently large."
 },
 {
   "message": "By when must the consumer commence any action under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act?",
   "response": "Generally, the consumer must do so no later than 2 years from the date on which the unfair practice was alleged to take place."
 },
 {
   "message": "What action can a consumer take in instances of  unfair practice against him or her by a supplier of goods or services?",
   "response": "The consumer can file an action with the Small Claims Tribunal. The Small Claims Tribunal is empowered by the Act to order the return of any money, property or any other item given by the consumer to the supplier; award the consumer damages to compensate for loss suffered as a result of the unfair practice; or direct the supplier to do certain acts to ensure that the consumer obtains the true value of his or her bargain."
 },
 {
   "message": "Does a consumer have any recourse against a supplier of goods or services who omits to provide key information?",
   "response": "Yes. The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act accords the consumer some level of protection. A consumer who has been misled or deceived by the supplier of goods or services can sue the supplier for unfair practice.  ?Unfair practice? is defined widely under the Act and generally includes instances where the supplier? s silence amounts to misleading or deception of the consumer."

   "response": "If the deceased left behind a valid will, then the executor will carry out his instructions. If the deceased died without a will (also known as dying intestate), then Singapore's rules on intestate succession will determine the distribution of the deceased's estate (see section 7 of the Intestate Succession Act for the rules on distribution). Therefore, either the deceased's will or the rules on intestate succession will govern the distribution of the deceased's estate.You should note that certain property may not form part of the deceased's estate. For example, property held in a joint tenancy at the time of death will be solely held by the surviving joint tenant. Also, any property that the deceased held on trust for another person will rightly belong to the beneficiary of the trust."

   "response": "There will be some amount of uncertainty in the absence of a will. First, if A&C; do not ever find out about the monies in the account, then they will not make a claim. Second, if they do find out, then it is for them to prove that the monies actually belongs to your mother.

A common scenario for this is where the company takes out a key??person insurance policy.On the other hand, the policy may be taken out for the benefit of the company's employees (assuming the deceased was an employee). If so, then the insurance proceeds form part of the deceased's estate. The Insurance Act allows insurers to either pay to the insured/employer or to those entitled through the insured/employer to receive such payments i.e. the deceased.

   "response": "Maternity leave depends on the policies of the employer - some employers are prepared to grant maternity leave even to single mothers. However, as a matter of law, the mother's entitlement to maternity leave (16 weeks under the CDSA) requires that the mother be lawfully married within 12 months of the child's birth. Hence, if that is not the case, then provided that the mother is not a managerial or executive position who earns a basic monthly salary of more than $4,500, she would only be entitled to 12 weeks maternity leave (8 weeks paid/4 weeks unpaid).She would not be entitled to baby bonus in any event as that requires that the mother be lawfully married."

   "response": "These are terms stipulated in the contract and should therefore be complied with.The three month notice period means that you must give three months? notice of your intention to terminate the agreement, failing which you must pay three months? salary in lieu of notice. Note that this notice period applies for your employer as well  ? your employer needs to pay you the same amount to terminate your employment immediately as well. It may be possible to avoid paying the  ?three month average salary? sum if this term in the contract is deemed to be a penalty clause. A clause is an unenforceable penalty where it is not a genuine pre-estimate of loss. Otherwise, any sum payable in a contract that is a genuine pre-estimate of loss is not a penalty and is therefore enforceable. However, the payment stipulated in your contract (three months of salary) does not seem to be a penalty clause as it is likely a genuine pre-estimate of loss for the employer."

Any sum payable in a contract that is a genuine pre-estimate of loss is not a penalty and is therefore enforceable. If there is a very large difference between the actual loss suffered by the company and the contractual sum, you may wish to consult a lawyer as the contractual term may be unenforceable as a penalty. If the sum was not stipulated in the contract, then the burden is on the company to prove that it had incurred a loss due to the breach of the contract."

The recruitment firm may only appeal against an order from the Small Claims Tribunal to the High Court in limited circumstances: on any ground involving a question of law; or on the ground that the claim was outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. It is unlikely that leave (permission) will be given to the recruitment firm to make such an appeal to the High Court.As regards the penalty of one month? s salary, it is possible to avoid paying if this term in the contract is deemed to be a penalty clause. A clause is an unenforceable penalty where it is not a genuine pre-estimate of loss. Otherwise, any sum payable in a contract that is a genuine pre-estimate of loss is not a penalty and must be paid.

   "response": "It depends on your specific employment contract. Most importantly, you should check if your contract provides for any remedies or damages if you were to tender resignation before 30th June. If not, then tendering resignation may mean the act of giving notice, and therefore you may be obligated under the contract to only give your 2 months' notice on 30th June, with your last day being 31st August.

Any sum payable in a contract that is a genuine pre-estimate of loss is not a penalty and enforceable. However, the payment stipulated in your contract (3 months of salary) does not seem to be a penalty clause in that it is likely considered as a genuine pre-estimate of loss for the employer, particularly since the employment contract is fairly long (3 years).

If the monetary compensation stipulated in the contract is an extravagant amount, there is a possibility that the non-commencement clause will be held to be a penalty clause and made unenforceable. The Employment Act does not apply to the contract as you are not in an employer-employee relationship since you have not started work.

If the material you prepared is IP-related, the general rule is that such material is also owned by the company if you were hired to produce such material and it was done in the course of your employment. The relevant punishment should be laid out in your contract as well"

   "message": "My brother is a hairstylist and his previous employment contract stated that he cannot work with a competitor within 10km of the ex-company. Is this legally binding?",
   "response": "Whether a restrictive covenant is binding is dependent on a large number of factors, with some of the most important being the length of time, geographical area, and scope of activities limited. At the end of the day, the restrictive covenant may be enforceable where it is legitimately for the protection of an interest, and where it is reasonable given the circumstances. Where the restrictive covenant does not have a set time limit, the court may either strike down the covenant as unreasonable, or potentially impose a time limitation that is deemed to be reasonable in the circumstances."

It is common for many companies to terminate their employees if they have an affair with their subordinates and this is viewed as an abuse of power. It is also common for no action to be taken against the subordinate as they are not abusing their power."

   "response": "It depends on your specific employment contract. Most importantly, you should check if your contract provides for any remedies or damages if you were to tender resignation before 30th June. If not, then tendering resignation may mean the act of giving notice, and therefore you may be obligated under the contract to only give your 2 months' notice on 30th June, with your last day being 31st August. If this is the case, then you may have to work until 31st August or pay your employer an additional 1 month's salary in lieu of notice to terminate the contract on 31st July before the notice period has ended, as you have described."

   "response": "It is possible to avoid paying if this term in the contract is deemed to be a penalty clause. Any sum payable in a contract that is a genuine pre-estimate of loss is not a penalty and enforceable. However, the payment stipulated in your contract (3 months of salary) does not seem to be a penalty clause in that it is likely considered as a genuine pre-estimate of loss for the employer, particularly since the employment contract is fairly long (3 years). As such, if you do wish to terminate your employment contract, you will likely have to pay the agreed sum."

   "response": "This will depend on the exact phrasing and terms used in the contract you have signed. If the monetary compensation stipulated in the contract is an extravagant amount, there is a possibility that the non-commencement clause will be held to be a penalty clause and made unenforceable. The Employment Act does not apply to the contract as you are not in an employer-employee relationship since you have not started work. Any claim against you from the workplace you have turned down will have to be a civil claim."

If $50,000 is the amount of money equivalent to the salary that you would have earned during the required notice period under the contract, then you may indeed have to pay such an amount if you choose to terminate the contract without waiting for the notice period to end.

   "response": "You may resign at anytime. However, you need to give advanced notice of your intention to terminate the employment to your employer. The notice period should be according to you employment contract, or verbal agreement. If it is not mentioned in your employment contract, you can refer to the Ministry of Manpower's website for more information on how much advanced notice should be given (http://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/termination-of-employment/termination-with-notice). Alternatively, you may also terminate the contract without notice. You would then have to pay compensation in lieu of notice, or a \"notice pay\" (which is the money equivalent to the salary that you would have earned during the required notice period).If your contract does not require you to pay for monetary compensation (in addition to the notice pay) for terminating a contract before the specified period, then it is unlikely that you would have to pay money for resigning before the stated period apart from the notice pay if you terminate without notice."

The terms of the training programme agreement may provide for contractual set-off, where your employer may pay your salary net of the your training fees. Even if the contract does not explicitly provide for set-off, based on the doctrine of equitable set-off, your employer? s obligation to pay your salary may be set-off against your training fees. Where equitable set-off is concerned, both debts must be due and payable. This means that your employer can only set-off your salary when it is time for you to pay the training fees.

   "response": "The legal issue is whether she has abandoned her movable property (legally termed as her chattels) in your possession. The High Court in Wong Seng Kwan v PP held that  ?the circumstances surrounding the discarding of chattels should raise the irresistible inference that the original owners had clearly abandoned them  ? both possession and ownership? . It must be the  ?clearest of cases? that the original owner has  ?a specific and unequivocal intention? to abandon the property in question. In your situation, the most relevant factors likely are the nature of the items and the value of the items. If the items were of low monetary value and your ex-girlfriend has not shown any intention to reclaim them, then likely she would be considered to have abandoned the items. The two years between the break-up and her request would likely add to your case, assuming that she has not contacted you during the past two years regarding her items."

   "response": "The landlord has breached the tenancy agreement. However, a breach in itself may only allow you to claim damages, instead of additionally giving rise to the right to terminate the tenancy agreement. There are a few ways in which a breach may give rise to the right to terminate the tenancy agreement. First, if one of the terms that were breached was expressly stipulated as a condition in the tenancy agreement, then you have the right to terminate the contract. Second, if the terms were neither expressly stipulated as conditions nor as warranties, then you may be able to terminate the contract if the breach has consequentially deprived you of substantially the whole benefit of the contract. Note that if the terms were expressly stipulated as warranties, then you cannot terminate the contract."

Pursuant to section 18(1) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, the landlord must serve a notice on the tenant specifying the breach, i.e. rental default, and requiring the tenant to make compensation, and where the breach is remediable, require the tenant to remedy the breach. Where the tenant fails to remedy the breach within a reasonable time or make reasonable compensation, the right of forfeiture is enforceable.The landlord may then obtain a writ of possession to re-enter the HDB flat.

If your claim was for unliquidated damages only, then you would go under Order 13 rule 2 to seek interlocutory judgment against the defendant, for damages to be assessed and costs. Where it is a mixed claim, you would go under Order 13 rule 5, and enter judgment."

   "message": "Writs summons issued. What should i do next?",
   "response": "This would depend on whether you wish to contest the claims in the summons or not. It is recommended that you quickly seek legal advice or legal aid if you qualify for it. If you do not wish to contest the claims (i.e. accept them), the plaintiff can apply for judgment without trial. This will result in a default judgment entered against you and a sum of money decided by the courts that you have to pay to the plaintiff. You could also attempt to come to an agreement with the plaintiff and settle outside of court. If you wish to contest the claims (you have a defence/valid legal excuse), it is recommended you quickly engage a lawyer/sign up for legal aid and enter a Memorandum of Appearance to defend your case in court within 14 days. A useful resource for your reference is at https://singaporelegaladvice.com/law-articles/writ-of-summons"

What may constitute a tolerable level depends on the duration, frequency and loudness of the noise produced by your neighbour.

If that fails, you may wish to consider legal action, including instituting an action against your neighbour for private nuisance and/or harassment."

A sole arbitrator can be agreed upon by the parties or assigned by an arbitration centre. As for a panel of 3 arbitrators, the two parties usually decide on 1 arbitrator each, and both arbitrators selected by the parties will in turn agree upon a third arbitrator (who will usually be the chairman of the tribunal).Seat of arbitration: This is usually the same as the place of arbitration. The choice of the seat of arbitration is important because the law of the seat of arbitration governs the arbitration procedure, and the courts of the seat of arbitration have supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings. Rules of arbitration: There are different rules by different institutions, for example, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Rules, the London Chambers of International Arbitration (LCIA) Rules and the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) Rules.
